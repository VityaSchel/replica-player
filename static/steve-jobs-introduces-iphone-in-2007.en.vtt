WEBVTT

00:01.520 --> 00:05.680
this is a day

00:04.080 --> 00:08.160
i've been looking forward to for two and

00:05.680 --> 00:08.160
a half years

00:08.490 --> 00:14.880
[Applause]

00:13.120 --> 00:17.600
every once in a while

00:14.880 --> 00:21.119
a revolutionary product comes along

00:17.600 --> 00:21.119
that changes everything

00:21.520 --> 00:25.359
and

00:23.359 --> 00:27.359
apple has been

00:25.359 --> 00:29.760
well first of all one's very fortunate

00:27.359 --> 00:32.479
if you get to work on just one of these

00:29.760 --> 00:32.479
in your career

00:32.800 --> 00:36.960
apple's been very fortunate

00:35.120 --> 00:40.160
it's been able to

00:36.960 --> 00:42.640
introduce a few of these into the world

00:40.160 --> 00:44.879
1984

00:42.640 --> 00:47.039
we introduced the macintosh

00:44.879 --> 00:51.239
it didn't just change apple

00:47.039 --> 00:51.239
it changed the whole computer industry

01:00.399 --> 01:06.159
in 2001

01:02.719 --> 01:07.760
we introduced the first ipod

01:06.159 --> 01:10.080
and

01:07.760 --> 01:11.760
it didn't just

01:10.080 --> 01:13.200
it didn't just change the way we all

01:11.760 --> 01:17.039
listen to music

01:13.200 --> 01:17.039
it changed the entire music industry

01:17.520 --> 01:21.600
well

01:19.439 --> 01:23.280
today

01:21.600 --> 01:24.960
we're introducing

01:23.280 --> 01:28.799
three

01:24.960 --> 01:28.799
revolutionary products of this class

01:29.920 --> 01:32.640
the first one

01:33.680 --> 01:38.920
is a widescreen ipod with touch controls

01:46.960 --> 01:49.600
the second

01:49.680 --> 01:54.520
is a revolutionary mobile phone

02:01.759 --> 02:06.240
and the third

02:04.399 --> 02:09.840
is a breakthrough internet

02:06.240 --> 02:09.840
communications device

02:12.160 --> 02:15.520
so

02:13.920 --> 02:18.319
three things

02:15.520 --> 02:20.480
a widescreen ipod with touch controls

02:18.319 --> 02:22.239
a revolutionary mobile phone

02:20.480 --> 02:25.440
and a breakthrough internet

02:22.239 --> 02:25.440
communications device

02:25.680 --> 02:30.640
an ipod

02:28.000 --> 02:30.640
a phone

02:30.800 --> 02:34.840
and an internet communicator

02:33.840 --> 02:38.720
an

02:34.840 --> 02:38.720
ipod a phone

02:39.519 --> 02:42.319
are you getting it

02:44.079 --> 02:48.160
these are not

02:45.840 --> 02:51.840
three separate devices

02:48.160 --> 02:51.840
this is one device

02:54.239 --> 02:59.440
and we are calling it

02:56.800 --> 02:59.440
iphone

02:59.599 --> 03:02.000
today

03:02.239 --> 03:07.519
today apple is going to reinvent the

03:05.360 --> 03:09.170
phone

03:07.519 --> 03:12.910
and here it is

03:09.170 --> 03:12.910
[Laughter]

03:14.159 --> 03:16.319
no

03:17.200 --> 03:20.959
actually here it is but we're going to

03:18.959 --> 03:23.200
leave it there for now

03:20.959 --> 03:23.200
so

03:23.519 --> 03:26.640
before we get into it

03:27.040 --> 03:30.560
let me uh

03:28.640 --> 03:32.239
let me talk about a category of things

03:30.560 --> 03:34.480
the most advanced phones are called

03:32.239 --> 03:36.239
smartphones

03:34.480 --> 03:38.720
so they say

03:36.239 --> 03:41.920
and uh they typically combine a phone

03:38.720 --> 03:43.280
plus some email capability plus they say

03:41.920 --> 03:45.200
it's the internet sort of the baby

03:43.280 --> 03:47.519
internet into one device and they all

03:45.200 --> 03:50.640
have these plastic little keyboards on

03:47.519 --> 03:53.040
them uh and the problem is

03:50.640 --> 03:55.439
that they're not so smart

03:53.040 --> 03:57.120
and they're not so easy to use so

03:55.439 --> 03:58.959
if you kind of make a

03:57.120 --> 04:01.280
you know business school 101 graph with

03:58.959 --> 04:03.519
a smart access and the easy to use

04:01.280 --> 04:05.599
access phones regular cell phones are

04:03.519 --> 04:09.599
kind of right there they're not so smart

04:05.599 --> 04:11.280
and they're you know not so easy to use

04:09.599 --> 04:13.360
but smartphones are definitely a little

04:11.280 --> 04:16.399
smarter but they actually are harder to

04:13.360 --> 04:18.320
use they're really complicated just for

04:16.399 --> 04:20.639
the basic stuff people have a hard time

04:18.320 --> 04:22.240
figuring out how to use them

04:20.639 --> 04:23.280
well we don't want to do either one of

04:22.240 --> 04:25.840
these things

04:23.280 --> 04:26.800
what we want to do is make a leapfrog

04:25.840 --> 04:29.440
product

04:26.800 --> 04:32.080
that is way smarter than any mobile

04:29.440 --> 04:34.960
device has ever been and super easy to

04:32.080 --> 04:37.199
use this is what iphone is

04:34.960 --> 04:37.199
okay

04:37.680 --> 04:41.600
so

04:38.639 --> 04:44.960
we're going to reinvent the phone

04:41.600 --> 04:44.960
now we're going to start

04:47.840 --> 04:52.560
with a revolutionary user interface

04:51.520 --> 04:55.040
is

04:52.560 --> 04:57.360
the result of years of research and

04:55.040 --> 04:59.520
development

04:57.360 --> 05:01.520
and of course it's an interplay of

04:59.520 --> 05:02.479
hardware and software

05:01.520 --> 05:04.000
now

05:02.479 --> 05:06.720
why do we need a revolutionary user

05:04.000 --> 05:09.280
interface i mean here's four smartphones

05:06.720 --> 05:12.639
right motorola q the blackberry palm

05:09.280 --> 05:13.440
treo nokia e62 the usual suspects

05:12.639 --> 05:15.039
and

05:13.440 --> 05:17.680
what's wrong with their user interfaces

05:15.039 --> 05:20.080
well the problem with them is really

05:17.680 --> 05:22.800
sort of in the bottom 40 there

05:20.080 --> 05:24.800
it's it's this stuff right here

05:22.800 --> 05:26.720
they all have these keyboards that are

05:24.800 --> 05:27.520
there whether you need them or not to be

05:26.720 --> 05:29.759
there

05:27.520 --> 05:32.320
and they all have these control buttons

05:29.759 --> 05:34.240
that are fixed in plastic and are the

05:32.320 --> 05:36.080
same for every application well every

05:34.240 --> 05:38.800
application wants a slightly different

05:36.080 --> 05:40.800
user interface a slightly optimized set

05:38.800 --> 05:42.320
of buttons just for it

05:40.800 --> 05:44.320
and what happens if you think of a great

05:42.320 --> 05:46.000
idea six months from now you can't run

05:44.320 --> 05:47.280
around and add a button to these things

05:46.000 --> 05:48.800
they're already shipped

05:47.280 --> 05:51.600
so what do you do

05:48.800 --> 05:53.919
it doesn't work because the buttons and

05:51.600 --> 05:55.919
the controls can't change they can't

05:53.919 --> 05:57.280
change for each application and they

05:55.919 --> 05:58.800
can't change

05:57.280 --> 06:00.319
down the road if you think of another

05:58.800 --> 06:01.600
great idea you want to add to this

06:00.319 --> 06:04.240
product

06:01.600 --> 06:06.880
well how do you solve this

06:04.240 --> 06:09.919
it turns out we have solved it we solved

06:06.880 --> 06:12.479
it in computers 20 years ago

06:09.919 --> 06:14.880
we solved it with a bitmap screen

06:12.479 --> 06:17.440
that could display anything we want put

06:14.880 --> 06:19.919
any user interface up

06:17.440 --> 06:20.960
and a pointing device we solved it with

06:19.919 --> 06:21.919
the mouse

06:20.960 --> 06:23.440
right

06:21.919 --> 06:26.160
we solved this problem so how are we

06:23.440 --> 06:27.919
going to take this to a mobile device

06:26.160 --> 06:29.919
well what we're going to do is get rid

06:27.919 --> 06:32.319
of all these buttons

06:29.919 --> 06:34.720
and just make a giant screen

06:32.319 --> 06:35.680
a giant screen

06:34.720 --> 06:37.199
now

06:35.680 --> 06:39.120
how are we going to communicate this we

06:37.199 --> 06:40.800
don't want to carry around a mouse right

06:39.120 --> 06:43.039
so what are we going to do

06:40.800 --> 06:44.800
oh a stylist right we're going to use a

06:43.039 --> 06:46.400
stylus

06:44.800 --> 06:47.280
no

06:46.400 --> 06:49.599
now

06:47.280 --> 06:51.199
who wants a stylist

06:49.599 --> 06:53.039
you have to get them and put them away

06:51.199 --> 06:55.360
and you lose them yuck

06:53.039 --> 06:57.039
nobody wants a stylus so let's not use a

06:55.360 --> 06:58.720
stylus

06:57.039 --> 06:59.840
we're going to use the best pointing

06:58.720 --> 07:02.319
device in the world we're going to use a

06:59.840 --> 07:03.520
pointing device that we're all born with

07:02.319 --> 07:05.360
we're born with ten of them we're gonna

07:03.520 --> 07:06.960
use our fingers

07:05.360 --> 07:09.680
we're gonna touch this with our fingers

07:06.960 --> 07:11.360
and we have invented a new technology

07:09.680 --> 07:13.199
called multi-touch

07:11.360 --> 07:16.639
which is phenomenal

07:13.199 --> 07:19.120
it works like magic

07:16.639 --> 07:21.360
you don't need a stylus

07:19.120 --> 07:23.759
it's far more accurate than any touch

07:21.360 --> 07:26.400
display that's ever been shipped

07:23.759 --> 07:28.319
it ignores unintended touches it's super

07:26.400 --> 07:31.520
smart

07:28.319 --> 07:34.319
you can do multi-finger gestures on it

07:31.520 --> 07:36.479
and boy have we patented it

07:34.319 --> 07:36.479
so

07:38.880 --> 07:41.039
so

07:43.280 --> 07:47.360
we've been very lucky

07:45.120 --> 07:50.479
to have brought a few revolutionary user

07:47.360 --> 07:52.879
interfaces to the market in our time

07:50.479 --> 07:54.400
first was the mouse

07:52.879 --> 07:57.039
the second

07:54.400 --> 07:58.400
was the click wheel and now

07:57.039 --> 07:59.759
we're going to bring multi-touch to the

07:58.400 --> 08:01.599
market

07:59.759 --> 08:04.319
and each of these revolutionary user

08:01.599 --> 08:08.240
interfaces has made possible

08:04.319 --> 08:10.319
a revolutionary product the mac the ipod

08:08.240 --> 08:12.960
and now the iphone

08:10.319 --> 08:16.080
so a revolutionary user interface we're

08:12.960 --> 08:18.720
going to build on top of that

08:16.080 --> 08:19.759
with software now software on mobile

08:18.720 --> 08:21.039
phones

08:19.759 --> 08:23.520
is like

08:21.039 --> 08:25.759
it's like baby software

08:23.520 --> 08:27.039
it's not so powerful

08:25.759 --> 08:28.319
and today

08:27.039 --> 08:30.720
we're going to show you a software

08:28.319 --> 08:33.519
breakthrough software that's at least

08:30.720 --> 08:35.519
five years ahead of what's on any other

08:33.519 --> 08:36.479
phone now how do we do this well we

08:35.519 --> 08:38.719
start

08:36.479 --> 08:42.719
with a strong foundation

08:38.719 --> 08:42.719
iphone runs os 10.

08:44.480 --> 08:46.720
now

08:47.680 --> 08:50.000
why

08:50.160 --> 08:55.200
why would we want to run such a

08:52.480 --> 08:57.040
sophisticated operating system on a

08:55.200 --> 08:58.800
mobile device well because it's got

08:57.040 --> 09:01.360
everything we need

08:58.800 --> 09:04.000
it's got multitasking it's got the best

09:01.360 --> 09:05.600
networking it already knows how to power

09:04.000 --> 09:08.000
manage we've been doing this on mobile

09:05.600 --> 09:10.560
computers for years it's got awesome

09:08.000 --> 09:13.440
security and the right apps

09:10.560 --> 09:15.600
it's got everything from coco and the

09:13.440 --> 09:18.000
graphics and it's got core animation

09:15.600 --> 09:20.640
built in and it's got the audio and

09:18.000 --> 09:22.880
video that os 10 is famous for it's got

09:20.640 --> 09:25.519
all the stuff we want and it's built

09:22.880 --> 09:28.959
right in to iphone and that has let us

09:25.519 --> 09:30.800
create desktop class applications and

09:28.959 --> 09:32.560
networking

09:30.800 --> 09:34.800
right

09:32.560 --> 09:37.760
not the crippled stuff that you find on

09:34.800 --> 09:39.040
most phones this is real desktop class

09:37.760 --> 09:40.880
applications

09:39.040 --> 09:42.720
now you know

09:40.880 --> 09:45.279
one of the pioneers of our industry

09:42.720 --> 09:47.600
allen k has had a lot of great quotes

09:45.279 --> 09:49.200
throughout the years and i ran across

09:47.600 --> 09:52.399
one of them recently

09:49.200 --> 09:55.040
that explains how we look at this

09:52.399 --> 09:58.720
explains why we go about doing things

09:55.040 --> 10:00.160
the way we do because we love software

09:58.720 --> 10:02.000
and here's the quote

10:00.160 --> 10:05.200
people who are really serious about

10:02.000 --> 10:06.240
software should make their own hardware

10:05.200 --> 10:08.800
you know

10:06.240 --> 10:10.560
alan said this 30 years ago

10:08.800 --> 10:13.600
and this is how we feel about it and so

10:10.560 --> 10:15.839
we're bringing breakthrough software to

10:13.600 --> 10:18.240
a mobile device for the first time it's

10:15.839 --> 10:20.959
five years ahead of anything on any

10:18.240 --> 10:20.959
other phone
